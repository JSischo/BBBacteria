# BBBacteria

## Purpose of the Project
>The purpose of this project was to take a partially completed dashboard that filterd through a JSON file to extract data pertaining to bacteria found in the subjects belly buttons. The partially completed dashboard included demographic information from the subjects and a pulldown menu to select each subject and display their data. The project was to add visualizations to the dashboard that will identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. As well as a belly button washing frequency gauge and a complete analysis interactive and hoverable bubble chart showing the concentration and types of each bacteria found from a swab analysis.

### Note
I was unable to get the bar chart to show the bacteria ID numbers next to each bar. Instead, the displayed values are an ordered sequence from 0 to 10.
